# UMJI-VE280-FA2020

## How to handle this course?

### Preparation

* Basic C++ knowledge (believe you have mastered C++ in VG101)
* C++ compilers & your favorite way to write code and test
* A linux environment (not compulsory, only suggested) Check [here](https://github.com/ve280/tutorials) to learn how to install. Besides these ways, I also recommend you find a server. [Aliyun](https://promotion.aliyun.com/ntms/act/campus2018.html), [Baidu](https://cloud.baidu.com/campaign/campus-2018/index.html) and other cloud service provides all have student plans. You can buy a cloud server in a relatively low price as a student (chances may be limited).
* valgrind: a program you will use later in the course. You'd better try instally it on your own system. If not available, you can try a linux system.

### Lectures

* You should be able to understand all the slides. You don't need to look too deep into the mechanism of C++. If you meet some confusing and weird knowledge, you can also just remember them (e.g. typedef)
* Looking at the slides are also helpful when you are writing you projects.

### Projects

* Read project description carefully and repeatedly. Takes notes when necessary. 
* Take some time to design and analyze before coding. You should have a general idea of what the whole program woud be like. You don't have to figure out all details at first. 
* Test!!! Don't just write the code and leave the project behind. Passing the sample case and pretest doesn't mean anything. Testing is also an important ability for coding. The time ratio of coding:testing should be at least 1:1.
* Good coding style & habit: readable variable names, necessay comments, avoid duplication, subroutines (Single Responsibility Principle), consistent indentation.
* Start early and enjoy.
